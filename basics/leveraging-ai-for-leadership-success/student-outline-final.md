- **Process optimization:** – AI could look at workflow data, even if it’s just basic timestamps from reports, and suggest ways to cut delays in something like equipment repair cycles.
- **Workforce planning:** – AI could take whatever data you’ve got like shift schedules, training records, or performance logs and have it spot trends.
- **Workload Prioritization:** – AI flagging which repair jobs to prioritize based on past downtime data.
